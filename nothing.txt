Indicative of low T (< 1e3), due to its low ionization potential

Zi, Si:
Do not deplete much, and are thus good for determining metallicity

C III, C IV, and Si IV:
Can be used to study the moderately-ionized gas phase

Si II, C II, Mg I, Mg II, Fe II, and Na I:
Can be used to study the neutral gas phase

Si II* and C II* form when electrons excited by absorption in the Si II 位位1190,1193, 位1260, and C II 位1334 transitions subsequently decay to the excited ground state (followed by a fine structure decay transition to the ground state).

Mg II, Mg I, Fe II, Al III
